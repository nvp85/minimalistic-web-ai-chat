It is commonly used to directly access and manipulate DOM elements without triggering re-renders. Additionally, `useRef` can store any mutable value similar to an instance variable, which remains constant between renders."

By creating a ref with `useRef` and attaching it to the target div, you can call the scroll method (e.g., `scrollIntoView` or setting `scrollTop`) to position the view at the bottom. This is particularly useful for chat applications or dynamic content where new elements are added."
