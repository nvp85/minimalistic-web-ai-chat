It is commonly used to directly access and manipulate DOM elements without triggering re-renders. Additionally, `useRef` can store any mutable value similar to an instance variable, which remains constant between renders."

By creating a ref with `useRef` and attaching it to the target div, you can call the scroll method (e.g., `scrollIntoView` or setting `scrollTop`) to position the view at the bottom. This is particularly useful for chat applications or dynamic content where new elements are added."

You can set up an effect to automatically scroll to the bottom of the chat div whenever new messages are added. This ensures users always see the latest messages without manually scrolling.
